 <h1> How to declare an array in Python</h1>  
 <p>  In this article, we will learn about arrays and how to declare arrays in Python. 
      We will use some custom codes as well to understand the arrays. 
    Let's first have a quick look over what is an array in  <a href="https://www.studytonight.com/python/getting-started-with-python">Python</a>. </p>
 <strong> Note:</strong>   Array does not exist as a built-in data structure in Python. Python uses list type instead of the array.
<h1>What is Array</h1>
<p>An array is like storage containers where multiple items of the same type are stored. Like other data structures, arrays can also be accessed using indexes. Elements stored in an array have a location as a numerical index. Each index starts from 0 and ends with the length of the array-1. Arrays use contiguous memory locations to store data. Arrays look similar to the Python Lists but have different properties and different declarations.</p>
<h1>Array Example</h1>
<pre>
    <code>
        array1 = [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]
        array2 = ["cap", "bat", "rat"]
    </code>
  </pre> 
  <p>Let us look at the different ways to declare arrays in Python. We will use simple approaches, an array module supported by Python, NumPy module, and also a direct method to initialize an array.</p>
  <h2>Creating a Python array</h2>
  <p>The easiest way to create a Python array is to create a Python array. This is a simple example of how to create a Python array using the <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/api/array.html">array</a> module.</p>
